# Computing-Assessment-task-3
This website is about sharing stories.
## Website Goal
The website will include stories about crimes or interesting occurances, some non-fiction and some fiction. 
The user will be able to read either non-fiction or fictional stories and will also be able to include their own by signing in and writing their own story. Signing in will also allow the user to rate the story. The rating of a story will help decide if the story should be brought back on a later date.
Each day 3 non-fiction and 3 fictional stories will be chosen at random from a database to be shown that day. Which stories are chosen will be affected by if they have been shown before, what their rating is, and how long ago they were shown.
