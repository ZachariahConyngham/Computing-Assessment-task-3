# Computing-Assessment-task-3
This website is about sharing stories.
## Website Goal
The website will include stories about crimes or interesting occurances, some non-fiction and some fiction. 

The user will be able to read either non-fiction or fictional stories and will also be able to include their own by signing in and writing their own story. Signing in will also allow the user to rate the story. The rating of a story will help decide if the story should be brought back on a later date.

Each day 3 non-fiction and 3 fictional stories will be chosen at random from a database to be shown that day. Which stories are chosen will be affected by if they have been shown before, what their rating is, and how long ago they were shown.

# Algorithm

## Sign up

1. Declare variables: email, password, username, other_username
2. Prompt user to enter email, password, username
3. Get email, password, username
4. IF username is equal to other_username, THEN
4. 1. DO
4. 1. 1. Display error message, "Username has been taken”
4. 1. 2. Prompt user to enter username
4. 1. 3. Get username 
4. 2. WHILE username is equal to other_username
5. ENDIF
6. IF password length is lesser than 6, THEN
6. 1. DO
6. 1. 1. Display error message, "Password is too short”
6. 1. 2. Prompt user to enter password
6. 1. 3. Get password
6. 2. WHILE password length is lesser than 6
7. ENDIF
8. IF password has less than 1 capital letter, THEN
8. 1. DO
8. 1. 1. Display error message, "Password needs a capital letter”
8. 1. 2. Prompt user to enter password
8. 1. 3. Get password
8. 2. WHILE password has capital_letter lesser than 1
9. ENDIF
10. Display email, password, username

The algorithm will let any number of users sign up, each with different usernames and passwords. An increase in users will not affect the efficiency of the algorithm.
